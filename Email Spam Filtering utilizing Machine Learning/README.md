Overview
The notebook begins with an introduction to the purpose of the program, which is to use the Bayesian model for email spam detection.
It proceeds with importing necessary libraries, which include data handling libraries like pandas and numpy, natural language processing libraries from NLTK, visualization libraries like matplotlib and seaborn, and various machine learning tools from sklearn for model building and evaluation.
Data Preparation and Analysis
The notebook reads an email dataset with three columns: a unique identifier for each email, the body text of the emails (labeled as "spam" or "ham"), and a column categorizing each email as spam or not spam. The first column is deemed not useful and dropped.
An initial examination of the dataset is conducted, including dropping unnecessary columns and counting the number of spam and non-spam emails. This is followed by balancing the dataset by sampling equal amounts of spam and non-spam emails to prevent model bias.
Initial Code Analysis
The code imports a wide range of libraries for data manipulation, text processing, and machine learning model implementation.
It includes operations for reading the dataset, preprocessing steps like dropping specific columns, and balancing the dataset for equal representation of spam and non-spam emails.
Initial data manipulation steps also involve cleaning the dataset, such as dropping NaN values from specific columns to ensure data quality for model training.
This summary reflects the initial parts of the notebook, focusing on the setup, data preparation, and initial exploration. The notebook likely progresses into more detailed data processing, model training, evaluation, and possibly tuning for optimal performance in spam email detection
