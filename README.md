# Virtual Reality Gym with AI Teacher

## Overview

Welcome to the Virtual Reality Gym with AI Personal Trainer, an immersive fitness experience designed specifically for the Oculus platform. This project leverages the power of Unity to create an engaging environment where users are guided through their workouts by an intelligent AI trainer. As participants engage in various workouts, they will delve into the fascinating world of physics, uncovering the principles of tension, gravity, pulley systems, and more. The core mission of this application is to equip users with the confidence and knowledge to perform basic gym exercises, and to enlighten them about the scientific principles underpinning these activities. By bridging the gap between physical fitness and education, we aim to empower individuals to approach real-world workouts with comfort and understanding. Improving their physical health in the long run.
## Features

- **Immersive VR Environment**: Experience a fully-realized gym setting within the comfort of your own home, designed to keep you motivated and focused.
- **AI-Powered Guidance**: Our AI trainer provides real-time feedback and instructions during workouts, ensuring that you maintain proper form and technique.
- **Physics Learning**: Ask any question about fitness or physics and the personal trainer can answer it on the spot
- **Verbal Communication**: Verbally communicate with the AI trainer, as it utilizes speech-to-text and text-to-speech cababilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Unity 
- Oculus Software

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/[utzerath]/VR-Physics-Project-with-AI.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity by navigating to the cloned repository's folder and selecting it.
3. Configure the project settings for the Oculus platform as necessary.
4. Build and run the project on your Oculus device to begin your VR gym experience.

## Usage

Once installed, strap on your Oculus headset and launch the application. You'll be greeted by our AI teacher who will guide you through the initial setup process, including explaining the controls and calibrating the space. From there, simply follow the AI's instructions and communicate with it as a real person as it guides you through the workout.
